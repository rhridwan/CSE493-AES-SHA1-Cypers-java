Problem-1:
First, we set a fixed key for encryption and decryption processes. Then we read a file, "java AES_Cipher Riyad.txt" containing plaintext, which produces a file containing the ciphertext (crypto.txt) and decrypts a file, "crypto.txt" containing ciphertext then produces convert the ciphertext file into plaintext (cleartext.txt). 
1. Need to have the file, contacting plaintext named java AES_Cipher filename in the project folder. The project will automatically detect the dedicated plain text in .txt file from the directory. 
2.Run the AesCypher.java
3. Encryption will be saved in the same folder, file named "crypto.txt" 
4. Decryption will be held in the same folder, file named "cleartext.txt."
Problem-2:
Implements standard SHA-1 hash function using SHA-1 algorithm    without using library method for computing SHA1 value.
1. Need to have the file, contacting plaintext named java SHA_One filename in the project folder. The project will automatically detect the dedicated file from the directory. 
2.Run the SHA.java
3. produces hash value will be saved in same folder, file named "hvalue.txt"
